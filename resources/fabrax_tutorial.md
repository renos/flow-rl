# Fabrax Wiki: Tutorial

This page explains how to play Fabrax, an expanded variant of Craftax Classic focused on metallurgy, glass & ceramics, and chemistry & alchemy.

## Basic Mechanics
Fabrax is a game about exploring, mining, crafting and fighting enemies. The player moves in the four cardinal directions using WASD and interacts using SPACE. Interacting can cause the player to attempt to mine (a block), attack (a creature), drink (from lakes), eat (plants/cows) or use nearby stations.

The player has 4 intrinsics: health, hunger, thirst and energy. Hunger, thirst and energy will naturally decrease and must be replenished by eating, drinking and sleeping respectively. Health will recover when hunger, thirst and energy are non‑zero and will decrease if any of these are 0. If the player’s health falls to 0 they will die and the run will end. Standing in lava is also lethal.

To progress, gather resources from the overworld, place stations, and craft better tools. There are 54 achievements in total (22 classic + 32 Fabrax) that mark milestones across the new branches.

## Overworld

The overworld consists of grasslands, lakes, sand beaches and mountains with ore veins. Begin by mining trees, then make a crafting table and use it to craft wooden tools by pressing the appropriate crafting keys while adjacent to the placed table. Use the wooden pickaxe to mine stone and craft stone tools. With stone tools, you can mine coal and iron. By placing a furnace next to the crafting table and standing adjacent to both (diagonal counts) the player can craft iron tools using wood, iron and coal.

Keep your food up by fighting cows, drink water from lakes and sleep when tired. The player is vulnerable when sleeping, so block yourself in by placing stone before you rest. When you are comfortable with iron gear and survivability, branch into one of the Fabrax progressions below.

## Resources

Wood comes from trees. Stone and coal are found in rocky mountains. Iron, copper and tin appear as distinct ores and require stronger pickaxes: stone for iron/copper/tin, and iron for diamond. Clay appears on beaches, while sand is common near water. Limestone is found in mountains and can be mined with at least a wooden pickaxe. Leather drops from cows and is used in early metallurgy.

## Stations

Crafting recipes require proximity to placed stations. Stand adjacent (diagonals count) to activate them. The base stations are the crafting table and furnace. Fabrax adds the anvil (for forging), kiln (for glass and ceramics), composter (for fertilizer) and alchemy bench (for tonics and chemistry). Some recipes require being adjacent to multiple stations (e.g. anvil and crafting table together).

## Branch 1: Metallurgy

Place an anvil once you have iron and stone. Make bellows at the crafting table using wood and leather. At the furnace, smelt iron bars from iron ore and coal, then smelt steel bars from iron bars and coal. Bronze bars are made by smelting copper, tin and coal together. With the anvil and crafting table, forge steel and bronze tools: pickaxes (wood + stone + bar) and swords (wood + bar). You can also harden the edge of forged tools at the anvil as a milestone.

## Branch 2: Glass & Ceramics

Place a kiln using stone. Smelt glass from sand and coal, then shape glass bottles at the kiln. With a kiln and crafting table nearby you can turn glass into lenses, and then assemble a telescope at the table using a lens and wood. Fire bricks from clay and coal. Process limestone into lime at the kiln, and combine lime with sand at the table to make mortar. You can place windows (consuming glass) and wall masonry (consuming mortar) as building achievements.

## Branch 3: Chemistry & Alchemy

Place a composter (wood) and an alchemy bench (stone). At the kiln, cook tar from wood. In the composter, combine tar with plant food (consumes one food) to make fertilizer. At the alchemy bench you can brew a tonic from a bottle and plant food, or brew stone skin using a bottle and tar. You can also make flux at the bench by combining lime and tar, which supports advanced metallurgy paths.

## Controls

Movement is WASD and interaction is SPACE. Sleep with TAB. Place the classic stations with T (crafting table), F (furnace), R (stone) and P (plant). Craft the classic tools with number keys 1–6. Fabrax adds placement keys for U (anvil), K (kiln), C (composter) and B (alchemy bench), advanced metallurgy with 7–0 to smelt/make bars, forging with Z/X/V/N, glass & ceramics with G/H/J/L/O/M/,/. and /, and chemistry & alchemy with Y/I/[ ] and \ for flux. The full mapping is printed when launching the Fabrax play script.

## Tips

Block yourself in before sleeping. Reach stone and iron tools quickly by placing a furnace beside a table. If iron is scarce, bronze tools are a strong alternative using copper and tin. Use the kiln early to unlock glass, then lenses and bottles. Limestone into lime, then mortar, unlocks building milestones like windows and masonry. Tonics and stone skin improve survivability, and fertilizer helps with sustainable food if you plant.
